# The typed-sort demonstration uses only public Isaac Lab primitive spawners,
# so it remains available without downloading a YCB/fruit USD.  ``cuboid`` is
# the public red block and ``package`` is a blue, flat rectangular package;
# each is named by semantic type and routed to its own target lane.  All
# coordinates below are metres in the public world frame (+X/+Y horizontal,
# +Z up), and every primitive uses the identity rotation so local XYZ equals
# world XYZ.  The red lane at Y=-4.03 m is the validated minimal-demo lane.
# The package source center (-4.25,-4.10,0.819) m is derived from the measured
# desk top Z=0.794 m plus half its 0.05 m height.  Its physical support target
# center (-4.35,-4.10,0.829) m is derived from support top Z=0.804 m plus the
# same half-height and is lane-aligned with the source, making transport pure
# world -X over 0.10 m, analogous to the successful cuboid path.  The moved
# support experiment at (-4.31,-4.12) m physically intercepted the low package
# and pushed the final center to (-4.24183,-4.12818,0.80905) m; the prior
# no-interception plan to (-4.35,-4.13) m added -0.03 m Y and finished on the
# desk.  Lane alignment keeps the green/yellow centers 0.07 m apart in Y, the
# support edges 0.01 m apart (each half-Y is 0.03 m), and target object-edge
# clearance about 0.035 m (cuboid half-width 0.02 m, package half-width
# 0.015 m).  Too little separation risks object/support interference, while
# excess Y travel repeats the observed loss.  The package's 0.04 x 0.03 m
# footprint remains below the public 0.06 m block and fits the Dex1 closing
# span and unchanged 0.08 x 0.06 m support.  These geometry values are fixed

# physically intercepted the low package and pushed its final center to
# (-4.24183,-4.12818,0.80905) m, while the prior no-interception target
# (-4.35,-4.13) m added an unnecessary -0.03 m Y travel and finished on the

# between support edges (each support half-Y is 0.03 m), and gives about
# 0.035 m target object-edge clearance (cuboid half-width 0.02 m plus package

# release.  The 0.01 m/s speed bound is based on settled public traces below
# 0.001 m/s and rejects a still-moving result.  Values that are too tight can
